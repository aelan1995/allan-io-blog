content: "Frontend development has evolved rapidly in recent years, with React emerging as one of the most popular libraries for building user interfaces. When combined with Next.js, a powerful framework for React applications, developers can create fast and efficient web applications with server-side rendering capabilities. Tailwind CSS provides a utility-first approach to styling, making it easier to create responsive and visually appealing designs without writing custom CSS. To ensure optimal performance, developers should focus on code splitting, lazy loading, image optimization, and reducing bundle size. By mastering these modern frontend practices, developers can create high-quality web applications that offer a seamless user experience."
