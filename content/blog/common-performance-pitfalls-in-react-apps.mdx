content: "When building React apps, developers often encounter performance issues that can impact the overall user experience. Some common pitfalls include inefficient rendering, excessive re-renders, unnecessary component updates, and bloated state management. By addressing these issues through techniques like memoization, lazy loading, code splitting, and optimizing state management with libraries like Redux or Context API, developers can significantly improve their app's performance and provide a smoother user experience."
