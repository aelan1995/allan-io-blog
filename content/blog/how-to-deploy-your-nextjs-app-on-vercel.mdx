content: "Deploying your Next.js app on Vercel is a straightforward process that can be done in just a few minutes. First, make sure you have a Vercel account and your Next.js project ready to go. Then, navigate to the Vercel dashboard and import your project from Git or directly from your local machine. Vercel will automatically detect that it is a Next.js project and set up the deployment settings for you. You can customize the domain, build settings, and environment variables before deploying. Once everything looks good, simply hit the deploy button and Vercel will take care of the rest. Your Next.js app will be live and accessible to the world in no time. Happy coding!"
