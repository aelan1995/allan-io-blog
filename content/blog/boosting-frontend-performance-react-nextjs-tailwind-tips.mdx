When working with React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS, there are several tips and best practices you can follow to boost your application's performance. By optimizing code splitting, lazy loading, and reducing unnecessary renders, you can significantly improve loading times and overall responsiveness. Additionally, leveraging Tailwind CSS utility classes and purging unused styles can help reduce the size of your CSS bundle, further enhancing performance. Implementing these strategies effectively can lead to a faster, more efficient frontend that enhances user satisfaction and engagement."
