content: "Handling API requests in Next.js is crucial for fetching and displaying data from external sources in your web application. Next.js provides several ways to make API requests, including using the built-in fetch API, Axios, or any other HTTP client library. When making API requests in Next.js, it's important to consider server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side rendering (CSR) to ensure optimal performance and SEO. By efficiently handling API requests in Next.js, you can create dynamic and interactive web applications that provide real-time data to users."
